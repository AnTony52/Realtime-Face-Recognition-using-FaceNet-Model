## Realtime Face Recognition using FaceNet


## Inspiration
* [OpenFace](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface)
* I refer to the facenet repository of [davidsandberg](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).
* also, [shanren7](https://github.com/shanren7/real_time_face_recognition) repository was a great help in implementing.
## Dependencies
* Tensorflow 1.2.1 - gpu
* Python 3.5
* Same as [requirement.txt](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/requirements.txt) in [davidsandberg](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) repository.
## Pre-trained models
* Inception_ResNet_v1 CASIA-WebFace-> [20170511-185253](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVOTVnU3NIaUdySFE/edit)
## Face alignment using MTCNN
* You need [det1.npy, det2.npy, and det3.npy](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/tree/master/src/align) in the [davidsandberg](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) repository.
## How to use
* First, we need align face data. So, if you run 'Make_aligndata.py' first, the face data that is aligned in the 'output_dir' folder will be saved.
* Second, we need to create our own classifier with the face data we created. <br/>(In the case of me, I had a high recognition rate when I made 30 pictures for each person.)
</br>Your own classifier is a ~.pkl file that loads the previously mentioned pre-trained model ('[20170511-185253.pb](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5MzpY9kBtDVOTVnU3NIaUdySFE/edit)') and embeds the face for each person.<br/>All of these can be obtained by running 'Make_classifier.py'.<br/>
* Finally, we load our own 'my_classifier.pkl' obtained above and then open the sensor and start recognition.
</br> (Note that, look carefully at the paths of files and folders in all .py)

## Performance
* After fit a bunch image of faces(5 images/face) for 3 person, model did not perform well, problem maybe depends on light where you standing, and angle of a face. 
* That's mean, probably you gotta need more pictures of a human face on different angles. But you will not be able to load a training set because of your limited RAM. (I've got only 4GB RAM on my laptop, and only 1.88GB RAM of it for GPU, which i use for load training data)
Hopefully, I'll try to implement OpenFace, or change tripless loss into softmax loss.
